TWONKY HUNT
====== ====

Silly game after a game of the same name that used to be distributed with CDC Cyber main frames with thier NOS operating system. I spent hours wasting time playing this and 'advent', a text adventure game. Play is simple, you get dropped in a maze with a 'ray gun' and hunt the ravenous Twonky. The Twonky is also hunting you.

Installation is the usual ./install, make, & sudo make install-strip 1, 2, 3. Distributed as source, so constructive comments are welcome. No real prequisites, just a decent C++ compiler.

I really wrote this as an excersise in using the automake suite of tools, sort of a personal refresher.

I tried to find references to the original implementation on the web but couldn't find any, CDC has been out of business for a while.

Don't bother making dist or distcheck, I couldn't get them to work, those targets seem broken with the version of automake I'm using. I may try upgrading to see if that resolves the problem.
